This is a node-red flow creating and registering PVinverter instances. (prepared are 3 instances, 
named MC1, MC2, MC3) which are fed from an ahoy DTU. (see ahoydtu.de) in turn The DTU connects and 
reads from Hoymiles HM-xx inverters of the given names and propagates the published AC-Power (P_AC) 
This is very alpha - but working fine :-)
